### 👋 About me

I'm an Finance student at **FEA-RP / USP** I use this space exclusively for documenting and versioning my studies in finance, algorithmic trading, quantitative research, and open source.

My main interests are:

- 📈 **Portfolio Management** – Construction and rebalancing of multi-asset portfolios using allocation methods (Risk Parity, Black-Litterman) to maximize risk-adjusted returns and backtesting
- 📈 **Quantitative Finance** – pricing, trading strategies, portfolio optimization, risk
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling** – from classical models to more complex pipelines
- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing** – extracting information from unstructured text
- 🌍 **Geospatial Analysis** – using geographic data (QGIS) to support economic decisions

Right now I'm building a portfolio of projects from my coursework and personal studies, focusing on **clean code, reproducible analysis, and clear documentation**.
